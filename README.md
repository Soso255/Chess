This is a simulation of the chess game, on a Visual C# Windows forms application. You can use these programs to calculate a solution for a state of chess game table with research tree depth 4, or 5.
Also you can calculate the solution with one, eight or sixteen threads.
Note that if you want to calculate a solution with a tree depth of 5, you must run the application on a processor of eight or more threads.
For the version of .NET, I have tried it successfully on .NET 8.0, and you can use .NET 6.0 or 7.0 if you need this.
